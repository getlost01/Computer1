# Logisim Circuits Design of Basic Computer Architecture

This repository contains Logisim circuit designs of basic computer architecture modules, including the control unit, arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), registers, and memory.

## Getting Started

To open and run the circuit designs, you will need to download and install Logisim, which is a free and open-source digital circuit simulator. Logisim can be downloaded from their official website at [http://www.cburch.com/logisim/](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

Once you have installed Logisim, simply clone this repository and open the `main.circ` files in Logisim to view and simulate the circuit designs.
